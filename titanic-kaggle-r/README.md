# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢

My R-based solution for the classic Titanic survival prediction problem on Kaggle.

## 📌 About the Project
This is a supervised classification task to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The dataset includes passenger features like name, age, gender, fare, class, etc.

📈 **Best Kaggle Score:** 0.78299

## 💻 Technologies Used
- R Programming Language
- Libraries: `rpart`, `randomForest`, `rattle`, `party`, `ggplot2`

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open `titanic_analysis.R` in RStudio.
2. Make sure `train.csv` and `test.csv` are in your working directory.
3. Run the script to build the model and generate predictions.
4. The result will be saved as `submission.csv`.
